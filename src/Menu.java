                Each day, your actions water, movement, rest are sunlight and rain.

                You stretch a little taller.
                Your roots grow deeper.
                Your leaves grow stronger.

                A gentle companion watches over you,
                cheering when you rise,
                comforting when you fall.

                There is no final stage.
                Only seasons.
                Some fast, some slow.
                All part of your becoming.
